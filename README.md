How many of your friends are liars?

I've recently taken an interest in learning R. When I learn a new language I typically find it best to read some but to quickly move onto applying the language to a problem. Examples only take me so far before building my own becomes the next step in learning.

This weekend I was reading Dan Ariely's column in the Wall Street Journal entitled "[A New Party Game: Who's Dishonest?](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324094704579068960871433566.html)" (9/14/13) Dan proposes a party game where each guest gets a coin. They predict the outcome of their coin flip, flip the coin, and then report if they predicted the result correctly. If they predicted correctly then they get a drink. If they predicted incorrectly they get nothing. The incentive to lie is clear.
